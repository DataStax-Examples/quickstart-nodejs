# DataStax Desktop - Node.js Netflix example

An introduction to using the Cassandra database with well-defined steps to optimize your learning. Using a Netflix dataset for sample data, your locally running Cassandra database will contain a minimal set of show data for you to customize and experiment with.

## Objectives
* Leverage DataStax driver APIs for interaction with a local running Cassandra database.
* Set up a Cassandra Query Language (CQL) session and perform operations such as creating, reading, and writing.
* Use the Netflix show dataset as example information across three differently constructed tables.
* Observe how the partition key along with clustering keys produce an optimized experience.
* Have fun!

## Project Layout

* [app.js](app.js) - main application file
* [netflix-shows](netflix-shows.cql) - foundation CQL for reference or use

## How this works
To get started, read through the comments in the `app.js` to familiarize yourself with the steps for interacting with your own Cassandra database. The functions invoked by the `app.js` are created to provide more flexibility for modifications as you learn.

## Setup and running

### Prerequisites
If using [DataStax Desktop](https://www.datastax.com/blog/2020/05/learn-cassandra-datastax-desktop), no prerequisites will be required. The Cassandra instance is provided with the DataStax Desktop stack as part of container provisioning.

If NOT using DataStax Desktop, spin up your own local instance of Cassandra exposing its address and port to align with the settings in the **app.js** file.  You will need to install and perform the following steps:

  * Install [Apache CassandraÂ®](http://cassandra.apache.org/download/) 3.x
  * [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) server environment
  * Use npm to install the driver: `npm install cassandra-driver`
  * Create the keyspace and table.  The `netflix-shows.cql` file provides the schema used for this project.


All of the connection code is contained in the `app.js` file.  The `cassandra.Client()` API is used to connect to your instance of Cassandra.

```javascipt
const client = new cassandra.Client({
  contactPoints: ['127.0.0.1'],
  localDataCenter: 'dc1',
  keyspace: 'demo'
});
```

## Running

Simply kickoff the app from the command line.

> node app.js
